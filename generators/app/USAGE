Glossary

  App generator - combining generator, generates files via composing Sub generators
  Sub generator - specialized for only Tech generator, directly creates files
  Interactions  - Options and arguments applicably by generator, base for Props
  Props         - Composed from options and arguments object formatted data.
  Entity        - Context object, roughly BEM block with optional params like elem, mod and so on.
  Scope         - Result of Cartesian Product of provided props.
  Tech          - Technology file with specific extension and content.

Key concepts

  Workflow :
    - Define generator Interactions, set applicable arguments and options.
    - Ask for additional information, like configs, context data.
    - Create Props, base on Interactions, format options and arguments data and prepare in for Scope calculation.
    - Calculate scope, get list of affected entities to apply action method.
    - Execute action method, create or delete file.

  Each generator works in 2  possible cases: creating (by default) and removing files ( --d option).

  Scope

    To support multi-entities actions, generators use Cartesian Product (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product)
    algorithm to calculate set from provided Props. Before calculation generator filters Props base on Interactions
    `combine: true` flag (by default they are blockName, elem, modName, modVal and tech).

    As an example, consider following command run:

      yo direct block1,block2 --m type --v inline,block --tech css

    As a result 4 files will be generated

      block1/_type/block1_type_inline.css
      block1/_type/block1_type_block.css
      block2/_type/block2_type_inline.css
      block2/_type/block2_type_block.css

Examples

  yo direct block1 --t css                                         - generate tech for single entity
  yo direct block1,block2 --m some-mod --v modval,modval2 --t md   - generate tech for multi entities
  yo direct block1 --t js,md,css                                   - generate multi Tech for entity
  yo direct block1 --t js --bb b-some                              - generate tech with addition params
  yo direct block1,block2 --t css,md --d                           - delete tech list for scope
